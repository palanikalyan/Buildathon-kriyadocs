The accession number is a unique identifier assigned to a record in sequence databases such as GenBank. An accession number is usually a combination of a letter(s) and numbers, such as a single letter followed by five digits (e.g., U12345) or two letters followed by six digits (e.g., AF123456).
The code begins by importing necessary libraries: re for regular expressions, requests for making HTTP requests, and xml.etree.ElementTree for generating XML tags.

The namespace patterns are fetched from the namespace registry API using the requests.get() method. The response is converted to JSON format, and the namespace patterns are extracted and stored in the namespace_patterns dictionary.

The input text is provided as a multi-line string, which contains the paragraphs to be processed.

The re.findall() function is used with a regular expression pattern to extract all potential accession numbers from the input text. Accession numbers are identified as one or more uppercase letters followed by one or more digits.

For each extracted accession number, the code iterates through the available namespace patterns to find a matching namespace. This is done by comparing the accession number against each pattern using re.match().

If a matching namespace is found, the code constructs the compact identifier by combining the namespace prefix with the accession number.

The code then sends a GET request to the resolver API using the compact identifier to retrieve the resolved data. The resolved URL is extracted from the API response.

If a resolved URL is obtained, an XML tag is generated using the xml.etree.ElementTree library. The tag includes attributes such as ext-link-type, assigning-authority, and xlink:href, and the text content is set as the accession number.

The generated XML tags are stored in a list.

Finally, the code assembles the XML tags into a formatted output by converting each tag to a string representation using ET.tostring() and joining them with newline characters.

The formatted output, containing the generated XML tags, is printed.

Please note that this code snippet provides a basic implementation and may require further refinement or error handling based on your specific requirements and the API responses.
